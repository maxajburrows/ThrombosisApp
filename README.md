NTD App

App to show patient information for the treatment of Thrombosis.

The app is currently locally hosted using a Sqlite database and is built using .Net 7.

To use the app run BOTH the Client and Server projects. The database will automatically be seeded with data. The app is in development phase, so if you restart the server you will lose any changes you made.

One you have run the Client and Server navigate to "http://localhost:5105" in your browser and ENJOY!!!
